# Soul Crusher

A browser extension for Google Chrome to the Guardian Soulmates website suck less.

This extension improves the Soulmates website by:

* Increasing the size of profile images in search results.
* Allowing you to hide profiles directly from the search results, rather than having to open the profiles.
* Making each profile link on the search results page open in a new tab.
* Dramatically increasing the size of the main image on the profile page.
* Hiding the sidebar on the profile page and shrinking the title to make more space for the actual profile.
